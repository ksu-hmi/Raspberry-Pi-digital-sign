- [x] Create account
- [x] Ensure internet connectivity
- [x] Connect 1 x 4 push button membrane to “breadboard”
- [x] Install IDLE on Raspberry Pi
- [x] Research other Python Consoles compatible for Raspberry Pi
- [x] Update PIP module
- [x] Update Python version on Raspberry Pi
- [x] Update Operating System / Ubuntu Mate to newest version
- [ ] Install required modules on Raspberry Pi
      - [x] Research and Troubleshoot errors
- [ ] Take Quiz for class
Note: Unexpected delay occurred in that I was planning on using a wireless USB mouse / keyboard combination that I already had and was unable to get the keyboard working properly (likely a driver needed). It appears to be necessary to have a hardwire connected USB keyboard and mouse for initial setup. Unexpected issue arose this week in that we did not have the required MicroSD chip necessary in order to install this (assumed that it was included in the kit that was purchased). Had to add another step in this process as there is an additional piece of software that was necessary in order to Flash the MicroSD card. The file was a .xz that had to have a different software to expand the file type (it appears that this is a Ubuntu equivalent of a ZIP file. 
Note: Unexpected delay occurred in this week that once the MicroSD chip was flashed and the OS was uploaded initially, it was discovered that the membrane push button that was acquired does not connect directly to the Raspberry Pi, but in face does need to be connected to a Raspberry Pi ‘breadboard”. Had to purchase a “breadboard” and have it quickly shipped in order to proceed with project.

Week 3 / Sprint 3
- [ ] Get working Python Console installed on Raspberry Pi
- [ ] Fill in correct pin numbers for Python code
- [ ] Verify pin connectivity by having Python code "print" return statement
- [ ] Remove commented out # items to include if statements
- [ ] Test that code pulls website when assocuiated button is pressed
- [ ] Take Raspberry Pi to work
- [ ] Get RDP access for reports needed
- [ ] Install RDP application on Raspberry Pi
- [ ] Get Raspberry Pi whitelisted
- [ ] Update code with proper links to pull specific reports (replace generic website placeholders)
- [ ] Verify functionality
- [ ] Troubleshoot connectivity as needed
- [ ] Run QA statistics on code as it is at this point
- [x] Update Roadmap / tasks lists based on research and testing results
- [ ] Complete PowerPoint Presentation
Note: During hardware testing, was unable to get pip module to properly install RPi.GPIO and other required modules for further coding and testing. Spent approximately 5-6 hours testing and attempting to troubleshoot hardware by reviewing user forums and chat rooms on similar issue. Setup meeting with Dr. Thomas to troubleshoot on Monday afternoon 4/22. In meantime, purchased additional MicroSD cards so that I can attempt other Operating Systems and see if they are able to allow Python Modules to be properly installed.
